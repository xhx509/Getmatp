# Getmatp
Code by Huanxin Xu beginning in 2016 with some very minor modifications by JiM over the years.
Gets temperature and depth data from Lowell MatP logger and location data from GPS receiver,  
sends summary data to transmitter (AP3 or RockBlock) and the raw data to WIFI.  This routine is run by the "launcher.sh" script.

Other routines are used to plot the data in the wheelhouse namely wifiandpic.py.
All code has been flowcharted at different levels of complexity with drawio. 
These flowcharts are available on request along with multiploe googledocs on the project.
